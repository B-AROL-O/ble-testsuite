# workflow triggers

# To test invoking this trigger, you need to send a special POST request to the following URL:
# https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/dispatches
#
# The request also needs to contain the following headers:
#
# "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json"
# "Authorization": "token {personal token with repo access}"
#
# You need to provide a personal GitHub token with the repo access scope.
# If your trigger also features a type, specify it in the request body:
#
# {"event_type": "webhook"}
